# Project Name

SD-JWT Rust Reference Implementation

# Project Description

This is the reference implementation of the [IETF SD-JWT specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/) written in Rust.

# Alignment with the OpenWallet Foundation Mission

This library implements the Selective Disclosure for JWTs specification, which is an important building block for future digital identity wallets.
Rust basis may be used as a source for high-performance wallets as well as a universal starting point for native platform-specific implementation for both mobile and desktop.

DSR Corporation, LLC. Denver, Colorado.
DSR Decentralized Systems Team has extensive experience in the development of decentralized systems and digital identity solutions, and we are fun of Rust.
In our previous experience, we developed a Rust-based multiplatform SDK for the Hyperledger Indy project, which later evolved into the Aries initiative.
The DSR team is also one of the initial authors of Rust-based CL Anoncreds implementation as part of Hyperledger Ursa and Indy. CL Anoncreds is one of the alternative approaches for verifiable credentials with selective disclosure support.

# Infrastructure

GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
